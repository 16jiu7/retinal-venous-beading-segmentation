# retinal-venous-beading-segmentation
This repo. uses real data from hospital to tackle the retinal venous beading segmentation problem
Step 1 is retinal blood vessel segmentation, using a U-Net-like CNN, the model is trained on DRIVE datasets and finetuned to suit the new domain, where data suffer from greater illumination variance.
